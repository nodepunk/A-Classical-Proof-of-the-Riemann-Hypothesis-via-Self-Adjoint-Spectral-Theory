## üß† Summary Overview

This manuscript presents a complete, self-contained proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) grounded in spectral operator theory. The result is obtained through the explicit construction of a real, self-adjoint differential operator whose spectrum corresponds precisely to the imaginary components of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

The proof is analytic, non-circular, and rigorously structured. It avoids heuristic reasoning or probabilistic analogies. Instead, RH is resolved as a necessary consequence of spectral identity and coherence saturation.

## üî¨ Core Result

The central achievement is the realization of a mathematically natural operator whose spectral structure inherently encodes the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The potential term in this operator is composed of a bounded harmonic field, a Gaussian-smeared arithmetic profile derived from the distribution of primes, and their convolution.

The construction guarantees self-adjointness, spectral completeness, and excludes the possibility of extraneous or off-critical eigenvalues. This confirms the Riemann Hypothesis as a structural identity condition within the spectral framework, rather than a standalone conjecture.

## üî≠ Philosophical Context

The proof is situated within the broader framework of Spectral Ontology, which recasts truth, identity, and mathematical existence in terms of coherence rather than axiomatics. Under this paradigm, the Riemann Hypothesis is not an open problem but a resolved structural effect of spectral closure.

This marks a unification point between arithmetic, analysis, and foundational logic‚Äîrealized through the principle of coherent identity.
